## (From beamer)
When you need help with beamer, please do the following:  

1. Read the user guide, at least the part that has to do with your problem.
2. If that does not solve the problem, try searching TeX-sx (tex.stackexchange.com). Perhaps someone
has already reported a similar problem and someone has found a solution.
3. If you find no answers there, or if you are sure you have found a bug in beamer, please report it via
bitbucket.org/rivanvx/beamer/issues.
4. Before you file a bug report, especially a bug report concerning the installation, make sure that this is
really a bug. In particular, have a look at the .log file that results when you TEX your files. This .log file
should show that all the right files are loaded from the right directories. Nearly all installation problems
can be resolved by looking at the .log file.
If you can, before reporting the bug, retest using latest version of beamer with latest version of TEX Live.
This can help isolate bugs from other packages that might affect beamer.
5. As a last resort you can try emailing authors. We do not mind getting emails, we simply get way too
many of them. Because of this, we cannot guarantee that your emails will be answered timely or even at
all. Reporting an issue is usually a better approach as they don’t get lost.
